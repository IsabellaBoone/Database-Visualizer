# Database Visualizer
This database is used to store information regarding players, creatures, items, and locations, and could be used in an MMO/RPG game.  The program will initialize the database, and add randomly generated information to the database.  Then, it will create a graphical user interfact that allows adding, editing, or deleting anything inside the database.
